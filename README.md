### Project Dependencies

* Mandrill -- required for transactional emails -- needs `MANDRILL_USERNAME` and `MANDRILL_APIKEY` ENV vars
* Amazon S3 -- used for file uploads -- needs `S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` ENV vars
* Skylight IO -- used for production performance monitoring -- Configure this by setting a `SKYLIGHT_AUTHENTICATION` environment variable
* ImageMagick -- used for resizing and cropping images in development; make sure you have it installed: `brew install imagemagick`

You'll also need to make sure Paperclip is configured in production to use
the appropriate region for the S3 Bucket you provided. This setting is found
in `config/environments/production.rb`:

```
  config.paperclip_defaults = {
    storage: :s3,
    s3_host_name: 's3.amazonaws.com', # <-- SET THIS TO YOUR REGION
    s3_credentials: {
      access_key_id: ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'],
      secret_access_key: ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']
    },
    bucket: ENV['S3_BUCKET_NAME']
  }
```

Finally, if you created a dedicated AWS "IAM" user account for this application's
S3 access, don't forget to set up an "Access Policy" for that user, giving them
"Full Access" to AWS S3 resources. More info on this step can be found [here](http://rexstjohn.com/how-to-solve-access-denied-with-heroku-paperclip-s3-ror/).

### Load-testing dataset

Use the following command to create, load and
push the current state of the database user the following.

Seed the database with the larg dataset:
```
  rake db:insert_mass_data
```

Create the dump file:
```
  rake db:pg_dump
```

Load the dump file:
```
  rake db:pg_load
```

Push the current data set to Heroku:
```
  heroku pg:push home_away_development DATABASE --app home-away
```
